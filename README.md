# Palm Crop Detection Using OpenCV and Machine Learning
This project aims to detect and count the total number of palm crops in drone images using machine learning techniques in OpenCV. The detection process involves converting the images into grayscale and RGB color spaces, followed by identifying the palm tree contours based on their conical tops.

# Overview
# The project uses the following steps for palm crop detection:

# Image Preprocessing:
Conversion of the image into grayscale and RGB color spaces.
Application of preprocessing parameters such as gray, blur, canny, and dilate to enhance palm tree contours.

# Contour Detection:
Detection of palm tree contours based on their conical tops.

# Counting Palm Crops:
Using machine learning techniques to count the total number of palm crops based on the detected contours.
How It Works

# Image Preprocessing:
The input drone image is preprocessed to enhance the palm tree contours.
Preprocessing parameters like grayscale conversion, blur, canny edge detection, and dilation are applied to the image.

# Contour Detection:
Contours of palm trees are detected based on their conical tops using OpenCV.

# Crop Counting:
Machine learning algorithms are employed to count the total number of palm crops based on the detected contours.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., scikit-learn)
Drone Images Dataset
